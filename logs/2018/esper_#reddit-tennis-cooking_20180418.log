[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> new meatball review
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> I tried these last night for dinner (was making spaghetti and meatballs), and honestly I am quite disappointed at the lack of flavour in these.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> I made the recipe exactly as written and these are the most bland food I've eaten (no I don't like spicy food at all).
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> They held up well and the recipe was very easy, but I'm not sure how the rave reviews happened, these had no taste at all and even the texture wasn't very good.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Am I missing something?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> :[
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> >these are the most bland food I've eaten
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> highly doubt that
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> hmm
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Somebody who is jealous of your blog
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i will respond to it if you want
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i don't think i've reviewed them yet either
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i mean they're not super flavorful sicne you're supposed to put them in sauce but they definitely don't taste ilke nothing
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> not sure what could have happened to this person
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah that would be the basis of my comment
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> that they aren't really meant to be super flavourful on their own
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> but i've also added extra spices to get flavour out of them
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> since I eat them mostly on their own
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i guess ill approve it and respond to her
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i dont think its an unfair critique really maybe its a messaging issue on my part
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah it seems reasonable
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> unfortunately
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> d0ne

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> thx

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Hahaha
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Itâ€™s good but not near garlicky enough
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> I need to put garlic in the dough and not just brush it in
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Brush it on*
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> on the whole i think i dont like vegan naan that much
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> its just not the same
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> maybe miyoko's butter spread on top
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> would help
