[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> alize
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> Idk I haven't modified any of the cloudbot defaults
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> I just testing the ability to launch it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> Inb4 pass the butter
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> .rainbow testing
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <ServeBot> (blekginger) 04t07e08s09t03i10n12g
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> this is gonna be a problem
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> i'm going to eventually remove the stuff that servebot already has
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> that is why this is only in -dev
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> dw
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> .help
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> thebotbot is a terrible nickname though
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> i will rally the chan to ban it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> unless you change
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> well 
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> i will rally against you
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> to unban it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> er
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> to not ban it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> then give me a different nick
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> to use
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> much like i rallied the chan to get king or Vaanir to change the serving colour to pink
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> and i will change it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> good grief
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> but it's green
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> i succeeded but then they didn't change it anyway
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> we had a decision
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> made
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> well i only wanted pink because hog didn't want it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> babot?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> i like thebotbot
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> doesn't even mess with the tab of th>thebogbog
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> we can use thebotbot as a temp servebot
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> in the years between servebot updates
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> no im gonna ditch the servebot features
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> i just wanted to get it up and running :3
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> ok
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> how did you get the git garbage to work
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> also i still dont know where to host it ? right now its just launched from my work laptop
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> babot is infinitely better than thebotbot 
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> i just cloned the repo
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> and installed the deps
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> hm
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> modified the config file
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> ran it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> and it worked
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> what os is your work laptop?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> blekginger: are you as lost as I am right now
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> mac
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> ah 
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> thats probably it then
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> i stopped reading stuvo
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> ok
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> the readme had some instructions about curl installing some shit
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> i tried to run cloudbot, ran into some problem with a specific pythonl ibrary
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> i tried to do it for 4 seconds and it didn't work
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> so i skipped it but somehow the bot still works
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> and i went down some rabbit hole about how theres no working version for 64 bit windows
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> o
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> if you have like a raspi you can host it there
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> i donut
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> if you dont feel like paying for something
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> or you can pay for a vps
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> if i make some halfway decent features maybe i will buy vps
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> right now i dont even know what i want the bot to do
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <kingoftrex> you can get one for like $5 a month
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> bog
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> yes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> can you make your bot do channel stats
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> pls
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> hmmmm
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> i need to quantify how much time i waste here
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> i'm not sure if i can do them retroactively
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> and how much of a loser i am
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <stevejhgla> you could with loglahoo
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <thebogbog> the start of a beautiful friendship between botlahoo and thebotbot
[esper:#reddit-tennis-dev] <blekginger> NO
