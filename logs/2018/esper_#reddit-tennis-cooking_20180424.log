[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> Yeah nahh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> steve's bad
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> ^
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i have roasted garlic in my fridge
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i should have roasted like 6 heads
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> but i only did one
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i made hummus last night that tastes like butt
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i need a good hummus recipe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> what reciep did you use
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> fucking dana
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> microwave hummus?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yea
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it is really creamy as she said it would be
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> but idk man, sabra just so fucking good
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> how do i not pay $6/tub
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i think store bought tahini is butt a lot of the time
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and that recipe has a butt-ton of tahini
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> so maybe something to do with that idk
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i halved the tahini
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> and it was still so much
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> damn
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i very rarely lay blame to the recipes i follow
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> in this case the recipe is probably fine, but I just don't like the flavour
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i do sometimes but it depends on what kind of claims the recipe creator does or does not make
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> for example of they title it "foolproof __"
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> "perfect __"
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> "the best __"
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> >challenge accepted
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> or if they say it tastes "just like __"
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> you know i told you about that bland ass vegan burgers and burritos cookbook
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lthere's a cashew sour cream recipe in it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and the recipe header is like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> "i tested this dozens of times until i perfectly balanced the flavors of the cashews with the other ingredients'
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and it's like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> 1 cup cashews
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> 1 tsp lemon juice
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i forget whatever basic bitch shit
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> haaha
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> the last step said something like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i feel like a slightly cultured cashew cream would be legit
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> adjust with salt pepper and acidity to taste, but keep in mind that adjusting quantities of any ingredients may throw off the balance that i have achieved
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> get an authentic tang rather than lemony tang
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> or something
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ya
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> what a stupid thing to say
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> the balance you achieved is for your own taste buds
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> moron
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> whole book was bland af
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> raw cumin added to chili at end of cooking
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> etc
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> she has a billion kids and it shows
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> My SIL is like that
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> I think she only knows of salt and garlic
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> When I go over there to cook for them I literally have to bring my own spices
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> And never fresh garlic - only powder
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> omg that reminds me
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> of a comment i go ton creamy garlic pasta last nighrt
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> I used a tablespoon and a pinch of cornstarch to thicken it. I also added a tablespoon of nutritional yeast and garlic powder, montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder ,italian seasoning, cayenne, chili's and fresh parsley and coriander and fresh tomatoes rolled in right at the end. It was pretty good! Go nuts on the spices!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Haha
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> So in addition to the garlic in the recipe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> -person who has no tastebuds, 2018
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> They added garlic, Montreal seasoning (which has garlic) and garlic
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> tbf i dont know what montreal seasoning tastes like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> oh lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> It‚Äôs basically just salt pepper garlic
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Maybe some onion powder too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> hmm
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> also why add cornstarch
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it already thick
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i hope the video helps some people
