[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> is that like leftover dough after making a pizza?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> The dough has come out much better with this batch than it has done in previous makings

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i am trying to set up vps today
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i think i may be able to use my website host
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and lump it in with my hosting fees
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> so that it can be a business expense
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> technically my .recipe command does direct people to the website
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> so i think i have a case there
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> yay
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> \o/
