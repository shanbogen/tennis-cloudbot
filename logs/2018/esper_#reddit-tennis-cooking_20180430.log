[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> wow bog your turnaround time for baklava is impressive
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ty, i stayed up kinda late working on it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i also didn't try very hard to SEO it because it's not a big search term
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> bananabanana: we got a shoutout!!!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Thankfully, my homemade vegan baklava is a little bit lighter. And in response to reader requests, I’m including a few step-by-step photos of the filling and assembly, which will hopefully make your life a little bit easier too.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> > in response to reader requests
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> that's us ^
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Hahahahaha we are famous!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> sort of
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> not really
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> .recipe banana
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> o wow
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i actually have hardly any banana anything on there
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i make scrambled eggs with banana
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it's a great egg replacer
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> what is this bullshit.com about?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lmao
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> oh i just put it in there if it doesn't find a matching recipe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> such a weird comment https://yupitsvegan.com/about/#comment-44869
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i think they felt offended about this: Whether you’re a vegan, a flexitarian, trying to prepare for a vegan guest, or just want some good, wallet-friendly recipes, I hope you’ll find some inspiration here!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> for some reason
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lmao
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that was the only thing i could come up wtih too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> do you know what "also-ran" means?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ok
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> so they're mad that i didn't mention their specific reason for being vegan
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> in that sentence ?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> maybe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> well then they need to work on their self-esteem
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> not enough information
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i can't be of help
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> "your self esteem is the real also-ran here"
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lmao
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> is she angry about the term flexitarian?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i think she feels attacked because she isn't "as vegan" as some others?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Maybe she thinks flexitarian refers to her?

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> hmm.  I didn't order my fast-food burger cooked medium, but that's what I got!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] * hoglahoo is afraid
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> if it's made of plants then you have nothing to worry about!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> enjoy!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> tx
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> you can ask how your burger is cooked at a fast food joint?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> At Burger King you can have it your way
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> Lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> Bog pls teach me the ways of the food photographer
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> That baklava looks sick
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Thx
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> I don't know how to teach
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> What do you want to know
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> the reviews are in
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/V37YPVcO/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-30%20at%202.15.44%20PM.png
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> congrats on the rave reviews :)
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] * hoglahoo can't help but point out that he notices the "you guys"
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i knowwww
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i hate myself
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it sucks wanting to use more gender-equal language but needing a man to remind me to do it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> it only bugs me because I grew so tired of hearing "hi guuuuuuyssssss" at the beginning over every fucking youtube video that hoglette watches.  I dont see it as sexist in any way
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> lol yes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> how long does it take to make your baklava from start to finish, assuming all ingredients and kitchen hardware is ready
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> and assuming average human dexterity and efficiency
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> s/human/guy
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i can actually tell you that since i was taking step by step pics and have timestamps
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it took about an hour and a half, including stopping to take step by step pics
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and stopping to research how to slice it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i think it is a one hour recipe when you're not a food blogger
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> by my estimate
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> thanks
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yw
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> these people are fast
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i use guys to include men & women. i say guys to a group of all women
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yeah, i have used it that way too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but identified it as a microaggression against women and tried to stop saying it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but change is hard
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> what would you use instead?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> y'all
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> mainly
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> "thanks, everyone" is probably acceptable and doesn't sound contrived in most situations
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> unless it is just two people
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> in the above case
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> I use "folks" often, but nobody else uses that and sometimes I get weird looks
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i could have just omitted the 'guys' and it would've been fine
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> yes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but instead i suppressed women yet again
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> by subtly implying that it's a man's world and women are just living in it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <Frosty> Did taking pics along the way screw up the taste/final product?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> not for baklava, no
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <Frosty> That's good.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> came out pretty much perfect i think. taste/texture wise
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> if i had tried to take a photo of actually pouring the syrup on it probably would've gotten fucked up though
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <Frosty> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> fyi bog you have the best avatar pic of all coworkers
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> imo
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ty
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i agree
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> sup with tobe just using a headshot
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that's no fun
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> they are your coworkers?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yea bananabanana can you believe it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> she shared with coworkers and not us
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> oh! i thought these people made baklava following her recipe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> duh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> <== slow
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> I thought that, too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> <== not ready to admit slowness
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> <== knew it all along
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> <== humbly admitting lack of slowness
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> stevejhgla: so when you make it, you'll share with us, right?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> I hope so - he already has my street address
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> ngl i will probably never make baklava
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> why not
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> maybe as a dessert for a party
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> ya that sounds like a great idea
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i will make it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> maybe you could share it with your coworkers
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> let betty have two slices
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> betty is in another building
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> for good reason
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> bog is tobe pronounces toby or tobe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> pronounced
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> is their last name arnaughtobe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah but they pronouncethe augh as off
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> unfortunate
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i thofft so too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it's like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> TOE-bay
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it's short for uh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> but uh is already so short
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i forget
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> he's nigerian
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i cannot believe i didn't have toe-bay as an option for pronunciation
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> for some reason it was toab
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> and toby
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i don't know. could something like baklava ship in the mail with any success?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i bet it could get to bananabanana before turning to shit, but definitely not steve
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> oh oh oh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i'll give you my address
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah it would take like 2 weeks probably
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it's all gone though nanners so you'll have to wait for next time
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> and they'd have to open it before i can collect it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> lots of places that don't make baklava sell it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> :(
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i will keep you apprised of new surpluses that emerge
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> hog
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> 1:34:12 PM <mostlybadfly> Kinda annoyed Amazon messed up and getting my ramen and chili oil tomorrow instead
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> 2:08:19 PM <sadme> sorry mostlybadfly :(
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> 2:08:31 PM <sadme> worst oil disaster since deepwater horizon
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> heh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] * hoglahoo is keen to receive news of another amazon mistake
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> I wonder how annoyed mostlybadfly would be if they simply ran out of his chili, never shipped it, and didn't bother to notify him until the day before christmas
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> ty
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> just out of morbid curiosity, no other reason
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that would be a really long time
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> I should stop lol.  people will think I'm losing it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> "what's so funny about running hydraulic calculations in there?" - people
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> 2:12:43 PM <stevejhgla> mostlybadfly: how annoyed would you be if they simply ran out of your chili, never shipped it, and didn't bother to notify you until the day before christmas
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> 2:13:16 PM <mostlybadfly> Lolol I’d be annoyed but I’d survive
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] * hoglahoo briskly nods in agreement
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> glad we got that cleared up
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> ty
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> it wasn't a direct answer to my specific question as no degree of annoyance was specified (though the upper limit of annoyance could be loosely construed as such, I suppose), but the answer given satisfied my curiosity anyway
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> , bogen.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i didn't want to take away from your opportunity to wonder
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> by giving you the exact answer you were looking for
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> I wasn't looking for an exact answer, only a direct one
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> sorry, direct answers are twice as expensive
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> maybe he should have ordered from tigerdirect instead

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> dosa has fermentation time to consider tho
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> No
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> What’s a diss
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Dosa
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> you would like it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i am 100% sure
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it's like indian food meets sourdough bread
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> yeah i thought it would be something you'd love to make/eat
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that was a great suggestion
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> noW i want dosa too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> yeah but of course i don't know how easy or annoying it is to make it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> have you made it thebogbog?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i did!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> vegan richa's recipe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it was actually extremely easy
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> kind of like bread in that most of the challenge was patience
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> the rest of it was just, you know, stir stuff
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and then cook in pan
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i believe i made green chutney and potato filling with it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i was testing recipes for her cookbook
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> oh i was thinking of potato filling too but with curry flavor
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yummers the duck
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> what are you making thebogbog?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i'm still at work
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i have eaten 2 gardein pizza pockets from the work freezer
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i will try to have another snack at home before i go to my soccer game, time permitting
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> why are you still at work
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> it's dangerous to ride a bike when it's dark, no?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> not dark yet
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> leaving now to avoid dark though
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> actually got in a fight about this with hvg the other day cuz he thinks my bike lights aren't bright enough
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and he's worried that i'm going to die
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> so unreasonable, this guy
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i'm with hvg on this one
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yeah he was completely right
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> I wasn't even disagreeing with him, he was just worked up about it, which I found very hot
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> hahahahaha
