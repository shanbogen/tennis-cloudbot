[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> how did the crab cakes come out?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> sounds lovely tbh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> using the banana flowers?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> oh yeaht
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> hey were fucking great
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i burned them though so i didnt bother taking a pic
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but they were really good
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> will remake with pics and a few adjustments
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> did you use nori for sea flavour?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i skipped the seaweed
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and just used lots of fresh dill, garlic and onion
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> ah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> decided i didnt care about it being 'fishy' really
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> just need to get them a bit more moist and increase the seasoning
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ...and not burn them

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> what did you use as binder
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> nothing really
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it got quite flaky when we cut into it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> breadcrumbs, chickpeas, an the banana blossoms
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and then pulsed up some sauteed onion and garlic
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> some mustard
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> a bit of lemon juice
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> hella old bay
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> oh yeah true
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> don't need much of a binder
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> since you want it to almost crumble
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i think it's ok if these are a bit crumbly
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> most of the recipes i looked at called for vegan mayo in
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and i omitted it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but i think i will put it in the 2nd time
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i used to make tuna cakes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> hella protein
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it might help bind a bit too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> 1 can tuna, 1 egg, a bit of breadcrumbs
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> oh protein
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i could put chickpea flour
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that sounds kinda gross steve
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah but
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it wasn't
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> pan fry and dip in ketchup
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> so quick and easy
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it's just a tuna cake
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> anyway
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i have a banana flower on my tree atm
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ooh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i used one 18-oz can
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i dont know how to convert that to fresh tho
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i will take a volumetric measurement
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and weight
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> after drianing/trimming
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> for final recipe

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> underappreciated recipe: https://yupitsvegan.com/one-pot-taco-spaghetti/#wprm-recipe-container-7783
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> you should make a recipe with tempeh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> hvg can't eat tempeh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> :(
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> why not
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> so i havent been using it much
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> the cultures in it give him migraines
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> ah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i have a new migraine trigger myself
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i feel like a new age tool
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but i am pretty sure i can't have stevia anymore
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> o
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> RIP steviajhgla
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i was food diary'ing a little bit
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and eventually noticed that i often got migraines after having kevita drinks
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> man i'm so fucking lucky
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> literally the only allergy i've noticed is to mint/menthol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i sneeze twice
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> that's it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> chew gum? two sneezes within a minute of chewing
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that's adorable tbh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> what a cute and fun food allergy
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah it's pretty great
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> ok that taco spaghetti looks bomb
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i'm gonna make that
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> >This one pot taco spaghetti is made by browning crumbled tempeh with spices, and then cooking it with fire-roasted tomatoes, onion, and pepper, and finally, tossing it with Barilla spaghetti.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> did you know you are sponsored by the same pasta company as federer
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lmao
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i am no longer working with barilla
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> because
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> their president said anti gay things
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i dont really care that much if he did cuz its not like they're trying to prevent gay people from buying their pasta
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> some readers got mad
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> ah yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i mean, if i can't work with any companies who have someone in leadership who is slightly anti gay
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> then i basically cant work with companies
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lesbianist
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Guido Barilla said, “I would never do (a commercial) with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect but because we don’t agree with them. Ours is a classic family where the woman plays a fundamental role.”
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it's also sexist
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i think homophobia is very sexist indeed
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> to say that men cannot play a nurturing role
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> in raising a child
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> is very wrong and unfair
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> correct
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i am offended
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> good
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> not rly
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> but i wanna be
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> oh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> .yt i don't wanna be
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> TIL steve hates nurturing children
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> correct
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog>  1/2 cup diced red onion
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i did good on that one
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> instead of
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> 1 small red onion - diced
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> ?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ya
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i recall this was a complaintjhgla
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> in the past
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> s/complaint/suggestion
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i think my complaint *cough*suggestions*cough* was to get
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> o
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> anyway
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it was to take an ingredient pic
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> so we know what size onion you mean by "small'
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yesterday before i started making the crab cakes i washed and cleared off my kitchen island
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and i was like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i'mma take process photos of this
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and then i didn't
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> hahaha
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> .addstory
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> maybe you could install an overhead camera
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> for process pics
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> my tripod is tall enough
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> oh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> its really just like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> the effort
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i thought hvg was only 5'6"
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> huehuehue
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> wanting to feed hvg dinner
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> I don't like 1/2 cup diced anything
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> you say that like he only has three testicles
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> that joke would be a lot funnier if he were black it hink
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> or anything but asian i guesss
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> I would not know how much I need to dice
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> you dice half cup
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> EZ
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yeah i think having both the quantity and volume
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> is best
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i'm with bananabanana but i see why people want it both ways
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i don't give a fuck about precise onion amounts in recipes, generally
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> 194 diced red onion pieces
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> 15 ginger grates
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> 49 black pepper flecks

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> oh, for the tempeh?

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> nvm i only have 3 romas, not enough
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i bet it would be ok with non-fire-roasted tomatoes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and a little smoked paprika or something added
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i will add chipotle in adobo
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> also
