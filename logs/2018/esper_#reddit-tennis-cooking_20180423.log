[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> And queso ish
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> have you tried the quesoish before
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> No
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i am curious
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> butternut squash seems v sweet

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> can you order one of everything
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> and let us know
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> actually i'm more interested in pics
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i'm getting kabul fresh grill again today
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> picture is nice
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> thebogbog: i'm going to go to latino grocery store some time to see if they have guajillo. if they don't, can i just use a couple of more new mexico and a few more chile de arbol instead
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] -!- Frosty [uid108333@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-qgbdbfumhzzcyckn] has joined
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ya, for tote
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> s
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but the inclusion or not of guajillo shouldn't dramatically change it so maybe i can help you troubleshoot the rest of it too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> oh ok thanks. i think i might have been just too drunk. realized i haven't had anything to eat all day but a bottle of wine and a few frangelico while i was cooking
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that definitely does not help with cooking/seasoning
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> The queso too sweet
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Not salty enough
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> https://i.imgur.com/I3TQm74.jpg
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i just ate some, and it's not bad
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> I am appreciative of the option tho
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Out of jackfruit
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Got crispy tofu
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> https://i.imgur.com/DuwYMoo.jpg
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> dat cheddar
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> no ty
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Lols
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> how were the tortilla chips
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Chips good
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> great
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> why does the menu say crispy tempeh but has tofu instead
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> good point
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> texture of queso also looks odd
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> this place is the worst amirite
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i am put off by the color of queso
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> the worst
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it's a strange food
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> oh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i bought a bag of masa harina for the chile colorado. now i need to make tortillas
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> so i use up masa harina
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ooh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that seems like a good project for you and stove
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> do you have cast iron skillet?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> do you have a recommendation
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> antique stores
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> or order lodge online it's not bad
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but the super old ones from antique stores are best
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> they are not as high quality in the presnet
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> kinda like what happened w/ pyrex
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah I have comments for this place
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> the queso was just a weird butternut squash soup
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ugh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> good eye bananabanana
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> send them my recipe pls
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> the tempeh tacos had tofu only
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> tbh the daiya shreds added nothing to my enjoyment of the meal
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> if they're not melted
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> then what's the point
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> hmm...
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i hate having to shop
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i love it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> oh good. can you pick the cast iron things i need
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> http://shop.lodgemfg.com/prodcat/skillets-and-covers.asp
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> ty
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> just get like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> an 8 inch
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> black
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> also
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lid optional
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i don't use a lid on mine much
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> bog what are your thoughts on enameled cast iron
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i like it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i think that may be more up bananabanana's avenue
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> no concern about seasoning etc.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> good point
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ive mostly seen that in the form of like
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> stock pots tho
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> not wider shallower pans
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> le creuset bb
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ikea tbh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i have one from them that i love
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but they dont hav ea variety of sizes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> enameled skillet?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> nice
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> much much cheaper than LC tho
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it was like 40
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> but lc got dat warranty
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> then again you'd have to fuck up 5 ikea pans to get to the same price
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> uhh... what
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i should go to ikea?

[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i honestly forgot we were talking about pans
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and thought you were recommending a dildo
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-EC11S43-Enameled-Skillet-11-inch/dp/B000ND5AAO/ref=sr_1_7?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1524507795&sr=1-7&keywords=enameled+cast+iron+skillet
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> haha
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> hahahahaha
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> oh is that the recommended one?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i'm going to buy now if there are no objections
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> if i were you
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i would buy enameled because you never have to worry about it being properly seasoned or whatever
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> but i am not you
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> what do you need a cast iron pan for
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> also, what type of cooktop do you have
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> glass top standard heating elements don't work well with cast iron...it tends to run a lot hotter than it should
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i already bought it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i have electric coil thing
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> depends what kind of coil
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> don't know
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> tortillas
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> i'm going to make tortilla
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> that looks good
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> the pan
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> will be here on thursday
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> nice
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> btw you could do tortilla ina  regular pan
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> though maybe it's a bit late for that
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> oh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> to be super authentic, maybe cast iron is needed
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> but I've successfully made really good tortillas in a non-stick skillet
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> what do i need it for then?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> need is a strong word
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i think cast iron is overrated for most applications
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> so i don't need it at all?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> probably not
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i don't use mine often since going vegan tbh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it's nice for browning things
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> sometimes you need to cook things in non-teflon for proper browning
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> yeah... proper browning might be important to people who can cook
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i use it for making flatbreads/pizza, which i don't do anymore bc glutenfree boyfriend, and for making hash
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> the potato type
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i put a little green oil in my potato hash yesterday
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it was a tad too much though because if i sat down for too long I could feel myself not wanting to get up
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> but as long as I kept moving it was legit
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> alright friends
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> pls don't mention this in the main chan because i don't like to publicize when i'm helpless and alone at home without a man to protect me
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> but hvg is going to boston for a week
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> so my question is
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> what gluten stuff should i make
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> while he is gone
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Consider it publicised
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Oh you said don’t
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Shit
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Bread
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Pie
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Cake
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Cinnamon rolls
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Microwave gluten powder
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> For maximum gluten intake for the week
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> cinnayummmmm
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i was thinking baklava too
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Is this for the site
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> always
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> k
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i don't have any classic cinnamon rolls on there
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and recently was craving bakla
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> The nice thing about bakla
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> Is you can do spanakopita same time
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> is that it's actually super easy
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> oh snap you're right
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> That also
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and spanakopita is even better
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> cinnamon rolls! i haven't had that forever!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> make all of them!
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> baklava cinnamon rolls
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and profit
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> thebogbog: mangos are almost ripe
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> which means mango pepper jelly
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> YUM
