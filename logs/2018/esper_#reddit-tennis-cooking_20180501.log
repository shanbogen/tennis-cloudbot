[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> that never prevented my co-workers digging into free food
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> heh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> it's amazing how much people love free food. they look at you funny when you say no thanks I already ate
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> things being free has a lot of power over people
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> there's some psychological phenomenon that explains it but i forget
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> its called welfare state politics
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] * hoglahoo runs
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] * thebogbog is unfazed
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> killjoy.  if you're going to completely ignore my weak attempts to tease and/or troll, then I guess I'll gradually stop doing it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> Bog do you have a special setup for your photos
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> um
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i guess i would say so yes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> nothing too fancy but i do have soft lights
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and a tripod
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and a pretty nice camera/lens
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> Ah soft lights
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> two of these http://lowel.tiffen.com/ego/
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yeah lighting is errthing
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i try to use natural light if it's available but if not these are a necessity
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> glare makes food look nasty
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> Ahhh cool
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] * bananabanana whacks hoglahoo 
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <mcpro> Yeah hard light is grim
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> hoglahoo: feel better now?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and most indoor lights are not very close to the proper white balance for accurate food photos
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> thanks, bananabanana
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> they tend to be way too warm/yellow
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> any time
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> should i be taking my food pictures outdoors
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> which you can correct in post processing, but the more you have to correct it, the worse it looks
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> maybe, if you have a spot outdoors with sorta indirect light
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> no i'm very close to the sun
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <hoglahoo> HDR example! http://www.fotothing.com/photos/2ee/2eed623137d696cedf656bed2e2624ee.jpg
