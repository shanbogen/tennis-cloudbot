[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Why does she live in the guest room?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> hm
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> she's shy
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> idk why, had her since she was 7 or 8 weeks
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> .recipe cat
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Not vegan, bog
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> good bot
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> .recipe catless tenders
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> .recipe tenders
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> stevejhgla Do they get along?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> very well
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Do you have people over a lot?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> once or twice a month]
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> So she just doesn't like you
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> basically
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> what's everyone doing for dinner
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> sausages and tofu scramble
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> o yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i need to tweak the sausages but might as well start testing the other breakfast burrito ingredeints
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> do you use extra firm for the scramble
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> ya
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> nice
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> me2
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i don't know that i've ever bought firm tofu on purpose
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Something made by Amy
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> That was my lunch today
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> I think the bean burritos are one of her best offerings
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Told one of my other vegan friends about recreating Amy's chili and he was like "why would you do that"
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> agree
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Why does he not like her chili?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> I like her pad thai
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Her chili is fine but I guess it's not amazing now that I think about it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Yes, pad Thai is good
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Samosa burritos
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Meatless loaf
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Cashew cream noodles
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Vegan enchiladas
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> All of those are gr8
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Oh yes cashew sauce one
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i can't figure out what happened to this person
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> Hm…mine didn’t turn out quite right. I think I may have measured out the 8 cups of spinach a bit differently because 1/2 cup of liquid was not nearly enough to get the sort of texture that yours has. Mine also came out an unappealing brownish green color instead of a bright green. I think next time I will omit the tomatoes and see if that helps.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> https://yupitsvegan.com/lentil-spinach-curry-coconut-rice/ it sounds like she either used frozen spinach or did not follow the instructions on how to cook the spinach
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> >Mine also came out an unappealing brownish green color instead of a bright green.
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> did they try photoshop
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> the recipe is legit green
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> you don't puree the spinach
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> so there should be green flecks unless you massacre it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> those pics don't appeal to me for some reason
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> hm
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> green and brown just not something my brains wants me to eat i guess
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> well that is fair
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i approved her comment since there is no clear evidence of wrongdoing
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> for situations like that maybe the in-process pic is worthwhile
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> like with the cookies
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yeahhh
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> amen
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i really want to start adding those to everything
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i could ask my assistant to prepare it and take pics without me
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> atm it's hard to coordinate our schedules to help with recipe shoots
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> is she vegan?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> even cell phone pics might help though, yes?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> yeah
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> mine was a cell phone pic
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i think she actually does have a dslr but doesn't really know how to use it yet
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> in my go to falafel recipe she does it
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/falafel/
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> albeit less professional looking than your recipes
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i think especially for food-processor consistency type recipes it would be helpful
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> my SEO consultant says that step-by-step photos are key in leveling up
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> it's very easy to go overboard with the food processing
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i am aware that it's important while also procrastinating
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Do you deep fry the falafel?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> i did the first few times, my last batch I air fried
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> actually the first batch I shallow fried
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i look at that and i cringe thinking how many times i will have to wash my hands to take a pic
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> it stresses me out so bad
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> I love step by step pics
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> yeah that's where an assistant comes in handy lol
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <stevejhgla> or maybe some kind of disposable camera cover?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Can't hvg do it?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <bananabanana> Shallow frying is OK?
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> i could theoretically setup my tripod on the kitchen counter
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> and get a remote for my camera
[esper:#reddit-tennis-cooking] <thebogbog> which i could cover
